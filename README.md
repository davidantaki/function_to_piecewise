# Function-To-Piecewise

Converts a function that takes in a value x and returns a value y into a piecewise function of n segments. Useful for f(x) equations that cannot be solved (easily) for x.

Used with hall sensors because the equation that tells you the field strength at a given distance from a magnet cannot be easily solved for D (the distance from the magnet).
